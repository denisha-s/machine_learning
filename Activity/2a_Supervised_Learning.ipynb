    "Some considerations with regard to how these notebooks will be graded:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cells in which \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is found are the cells where your graded code should be written.\n",
    "2. In order to test out or debug your code you may also create notebook cells or edit existing notebook cells other than \"# YOUR CODE HERE\". We actually highly recommend you do so to gain a better understanding of what is happening. However, during grading, **these changes are ignored**. \n",
    "2. You must ensure that all your code for the particular task is available in the cells that say \"# YOUR CODE HERE\"\n",
    "3. Every cell that says \"# YOUR CODE HERE\" is followed by a \"raise NotImplementedError\". You need to remove that line. During grading, if an error occurs then you will not receive points for your work in that section.\n",
    "4. If your code passes the \"assert\" statements, then no output will result. If your code fails the \"assert\" statements, you will get an \"AssertionError\". Getting an assertion error means you will not receive points for that particular task.\n",
    "5. If you edit the \"assert\" statements to make your code pass, they will still fail when they are graded since the \"assert\" statements will revert to the original. Make sure you don't edit the assert statements.\n",
    "6. We may sometimes have \"hidden\" tests for grading. This means that passing the visible \"assert\" statements is not sufficient. The \"assert\" statements are there as a guide but you need to make sure you understand what you're required to do and ensure that you are doing it correctly. Passing the visible tests is necessary but not sufficient to get the grade for that cell.\n",
    "7. When you are asked to define a function, make sure you **don't** use any variables outside of the parameters passed to the function. You can think of the parameters being passed to the function as a hint. Make sure you're using all of those variables.\n",
    "8. Finally, **make sure you run \"Kernel > Restart and Run All\"** and pass all the asserts before submitting. If you don't restart the kernel, there may be some code that you ran and deleted that is still being used and that was why your asserts were passing."
